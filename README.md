# Just Another Random Function Repository

Jarfr is repository of function that I found usefull during my projects, and would love to reuse them (productivity freaks)
Clone it, Pull some issues and all that, either way open-source is FREE

# Current Functions

1. findAN(string) - get the packets of alphabets and numbers
2. strSec(string) - find seconds in following string '1h 1m 1s'
3. nodeConnect(obj, obj) - returns the value for 'd' attribute to create connections between ports of node editor
4. inObject(obj, searchString) - check wether a string is in object (nested objects) or not
5. funcToFJSON(function) - convert a function to the string for string-based data management like saving a function in JSON
